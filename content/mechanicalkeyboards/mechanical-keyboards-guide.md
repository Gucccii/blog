7red## Introduction Q&A
### What is a mechanical keyboard?

* A mechanical keyboard is a keyboard that uses a spring and switch mechanism to relay text onto the users screen.

### How does a mechanical keyboard work?

* A mechanical keyboard is composed of individual switches that are soldered onto a PCB. Inside each individual switch, there are 6 main components, the stem, slider, contact leaf, contact plate, and spring. **[Read more](#)**

### What makes mechanical keyboard better than their counterparts?

* Nothing. Wait what? Yes, if you view keyboards as just a tool to write text, they won't do anything objectively better for the average person. However, mechanical keyboards have a higher life span than traditional keyboards and being able to chose the feeling, design, layout, and aesthetics, is enough for a lot of users to make the switch.

## History

So, you made it past the introduction, guessing you're intrigued enough to continue down the slippery rabbit hole that is mechanical keyboards. Let's take a look at the history of mechanical keyboards.

### The first keyboard

Not taking into account type writers, which are in fact mechanical, the first keyboard produced was the Datapoint 3300 which was announced in 1967 and started to ship in 1969.

### IBM Keyboards

In August 1981, IBM released what people consider to be the greatest keyboard of all time, the IBM Model F. It featured a 101 key layout, mechanical buckling springs, and came in at a whopping 8.3 lbs or 3.7 kilos. Quickly after the release of the Model F, IBM released their newest keyboard that was cheaper to produce, which allowed more users to purchase it and is probably the most famous keyboard of all time. Let's take a look at the IBM Model M. 

The IBM Model M was the first keyboard to introduce the standard qwerty layout, which is one of the biggest gripes about Model F. This layout was so well regarded in fact, that it is still used to this day. The Model M came with membrane buckling springs, which produce more noise, have lower spring resistance, and don't produce the iconic pinging noise that the Model F produced. Instead of the metal case likes it's older brother, it uses a plastic case which reduced the weight and dampened the vibrations produced.

### Today

Well, what happened after the release of IBM, Apple, and Dells mechanical keyboards. Well, to put it bluntly, they went to shit. The first design to incoporate the new membrane switch technology, was the DC-50. It wasn't a true membrane keyboard compared to todays keyboards, as it uses strips of metal for contact points. Todays keyboards mostly consist of membrane style switches which use a membrane layer that houses conductive traces, which when pressed down, pushes the membrane layer into the bottom membrane layer which creates a circuit, thus, executing the character.

## Chosing a Mechanical Keyboard

Okay enough of this mumbo-jumbo, let's get into the fun stuff, and the reason you probably visited this guide.

### Intro

There are a lot of components that define a mechanical keyboard. Typically, when building a keyboard or purchasing prebuilt-boards, they all contain the same main components. These components are the switches, PCB, plate, stabilizers, case, and keycaps. Let's take a look at the different options avaliable.

### Switches

One of the highlights of mechanical keyboards compared to standard keyboards is the ability to chose your switch. Each switch has a different feel, sound, weight, and characteristics that define it. You can tell what switch you have by looking at the color of the stem. Each different switch typically has a color that correlates to what type it is. Here's how to know what switch suits your needs.

### Switches: Clicky/Tactile/Linear

Clicky: 
Clicky switches feature a clickbar that when pressed, give the user tactile feedback and a loud and distinct noise.

Tactile:
Tactile switches have a bump in the downstroke that gives the user tactile feedback, though usually not as big as clicky switches. These switches produce a lot less noise than clicky switches.

Linear:
Linear switches, as the name implies, have a linear downstroke with no tactile feedback and no sound. The only sound you will hear with these keyboards is when bottoming-out.

### Switches Q&A

What is the best switch for gaming?

* Despite what you hear from the likes of razer/corsair and keyboards marketed towards gamers, there is no best switch for gaming. It's all marketing propaganda to lure buyers into purchasing their products. Pick a switch that you like and feel comfortable with. Low profile switches in theory should have a faster input time due to the low actuation and travel distance, but it's probably unnoticable.

What is the best switch for typing?

* Like stated above, there is no best switch for typing. It's all personal preference, although a lot of typists prefer clicky or tactile switches because the immediate feedback of knowing you pressed and activated the key.

### Switch Manufactures

Here is a list of switch manufactures and a short summary of who and what they do.

Cherry:
Cherry is a german company that is the most successful switch manufacturer, and one of the first to mass produce mechanical switches.

Gateron: Gateron is a chinese company that produces switches that are similar to cherry mx. Users typically say these switches are smoother than cherry switches, which some people describe as scratchy.

Kailh: Kailh, short for Kaihua Electronics, is a company based in china that also produces switches. Kailh also creates custom switches for other companies(ex: Novelkeys).

Razer: Razer first started making keyboards that featured cherry mx switches, but have since moved on to "in house" switches. Despite razers claims, these are actually produced by manufactures Kailh and Greetech, probably to cut costs and increase profit margins.

Romer-G: Romer-G switches are a colab between Logitech and switch manufacture Omron.

Topre: Topre is a japanese company that creates it's own switch that features electro capacitive switches. Although they are technically membrane and not mechanical, I included them because they are great high quality switches with a unique feeling dissimilar to membrane boards.

Alps: Alps was one of the OGs when it comes to switches. Alps produces some of the best switches, and older models of alps boards are harvested for their switches as they are rare and highly desirable.

Matias: As alps was close to being terminated, Matias set out to clone the switches instead of cherry switches because cherry switches "felt and sounded cheap to us". These switches are 5x as durable as alps switches and are used in a lot of professional work spaces such as stenography.

### PCB
PCB is short for printed circuit board, which houses and connects all the electronic components of a keyboard. When creating a keyboard, a PCB is needed unless you hand-wire it. PCBs hold together the switches once they are soldered into place. PCBs come in different formfactors depending on the keyboard layout. PCBs can also have lighting which can light up the the keys if you are in a darkspace. PCBS can also have RGB lighting which can produce 16.8 million different colors in order to give the keyboard a cool effect. A lot of PCBs nowadays also have lights on the underside which creates an underglow effect.

### Plates
Plates give the keyboard extra rigidity in oder to make it flex less and feel more premium. When a plate is in a keyboard it is known as plate-mounted. Plate mounted keyboards have a metal/alimunium/brass/carbon-fibre plate that is sandwiched in-between the PCB and switches. When a keyboard doesn't have a plate, it is known as PCB-mounted. PCB-mounted means the switches are soldered directly into the PCB without the use of a plate. These tend to be less premium feeling and can make the switches bounce up and down while being easily flexible. Plates are manufactured with different sizes and shapes which are tailored to the keyboards layout.

### Stabilizers
Stabilizers are placed where the longer keys are in order to stabilize them and to hold them in place. Without a stabilizer, the keys would flex from side to side, which makes for a terrible typing experience. Stabilizers are placed next to the spacebar, shift, enter, and backspace keys. Stabilizers are a lot of the time made by the manufacture of the keyboard, and on cheaper boards are quite bad. Cherry and GMK stabilizers are the highest quality stabilizers available, and tend not to rattle like their cheaper counterparts.

### Case
Cases are what hold all of the keyboards components into place. Cases are available in a lot of different materials such as plastic, aluminium, acrylic, and wood. Plastic cases are the cheapest feeling and looking cases and are used in a lot of budget boards. Aluminum cases produce a better sound than plastic cases as they don't have the hollow sound and are more durable. Aluminum cases also can create a pinging noise due to aluminums characteristics which can be dampedened using foam inserts under the pcb. Acyrlic cases are used in builds that have underglow lighting which allow the lights to shine through to create a neat effect. Wood cases have a deeper and more muted sound than metal cases and don't create that annoying pinging sound. Wood cases also give the keyboard a beautiful asthetic, and differentiats itself from the standard plastic/aluminum cases.

### Keycaps
Keycaps give the keyboard a nice aesthetic and allows your keyboard to differentiate from the rest. Keycaps are not all the same however, some use different materials, thicknesses, type faces, profiles, and different letter printing methods. Here is a short summary of keycap types.

### Keycap: Materials
ABS(Acrulonitrile Butadience Styrene): ABS is on the lower end of keycap materials. Typically ABS has a very smooth and slippery finish which feels quite cheap in the hands. ABS keycaps also tend to shine over time which looks pretty cheap and bad. ABS caps can also tend to yellow over time and are not very durable.

PBT(Polybutylene Terephthalate): PBT are the more expensive option when it comes to keycaps. You would typically find higher end boards to use PBT keycaps over ABS for a few reasons. PBT has a more premium feel and is a little more grippy thanks to it's rough texture. PBT also is much more durable in the sense that it won't wear away after heavy use. PBT also fixes the problem ABS has as it won't shine or yellow over time.

### Keycap: Profiles
Keycaps come in a ton of different profiles that have different curves and characteristics. Heres the most popular keycap profiles avaliable.

OEM: OEM profile caps are tall and are the typically the standard keycaps on keyboards.

Cherry: Cherry profile keycaps are lower and have sharper edges on the top and bottom and are contoured.

DCS: DCS profiled caps are manufactured by Signature Plastics and are cylinderical, sculputred, and have different angled tops for each row.

DSA: DSA is low profile, spherical, and all of the keycaps have the same height.

SA: Manufactured by Signature Plastics, SA is high profile, spherical, and has the same profile for all rows.

GMK: GMK is a cherry profile keycap that is doubleshot ABS.

### Keycap: Thickness
Keycaps come in different thicknesses and are mostly referred to as single shot and double shot. Single shot keycaps have 1 layer of plastic where as double shot have two inserts of plastic which makes them thicker. There is both single/double shot ABS and single/double shot PBT.

### Keycap: Legends
Laser Etching: A laser is used to etch the letters onto the keycap.

Charring: Heat is used to mark and darken the letters onto the keycap.

Foaming: A laser is used to foam and form bubbles that mark the letters onto the keycap.

Dye sublimation: Dye sublamation is a process in which heat is used to sink dye into the keycaps.

Double Shot Injection: Instead of using a laser or heat to etch letters into the keycap, the legend is molded onto the top layer of plastic and a second layer is molded around it to form the lettering.

Engraving: A machine engraves the legends onto the keycaps. Usually this method is used in shine through caps.

Screen Printing: The keycap starts with a hollowed out letter, and is painted inside the hollowed out section to form a letter.

### Keyboard Layouts

Full-size(101-114 Keys): Fullsize keyboards feature the QWERTY layout, arrow cluster, Prnt/Home/Pg keys, along with a numpad.

TKL(87 Keys): Tenkeyless is the same as fullsize, without the numpad.

65%: 65 percent keyboards are 60 percent keyboards with an extra row to make room for the arrow keys and and insert, delete, and page keys.

60%(61 Key): 60 percent keyboards ditch the function keys, arrow cluster and numpad. 60 percents commonly use FN + (key) to get to the function and arrow keys. 60 percents can also have arrow keys by removing the right bottom row keys.

40%(40-45 Key): 40 percent keyboards do not have function or number keys. Users typically program this keyboard by using numerous layers in order to access the keys not present on the board.

Staggered: Staggered Keyboards are arranged to where the keys are ordered in a staggered row. This is the standard layout and is found on pretty much all preassembled and non-enthusiast boards.

Ortholinear: Instead of using staggered rows, ortholinear keyboards have straight vertical rows that are supposed to mimic your fingers natural vertical and horizontal movement.

Ergo/Split: Made popular by the Ergodox, which is an open source keyboard layout and design, this layout splits the keyboard into two halves that allow your writs and forearms to have a more natural position. These keyboards can come in both staggered and ortholinear layouts. This layout can also include a thumb-cluster for easy access to keys positioned near your thumbs.

QWERTY-ANSI: QWERTY is named after the first 6 alphabetical keys present. This layout was made popular by the famous Model M, which was the first keyboard to use this layout. QWERTY was designed to slow your typing down, because at the time typewriters would jam if too many keys were pressed too fast.

QWERTY-ISO: This layout is used in many European countries as a replacement for ANSI. This layout features a split left shift, a "big ass enter", and an Alt Gr key for typing European symbols such as the euro symbol €.

Dvorak: Dvorak layout was created by August Dvorak and Willaim Dealey, this layout has consonants on the right and vowels on the left of the homerow. It's designed for your fingers to key in a back and forth motion. 70 percent of all the most used letters are on the homerow.

Colemak: Colemak is a modern version and alternative to both QWERTY and Dvorak created by Shai Coleman. It used QWERTY as a base with a change to the 17/26 letters in order to make it easier to learn than Dvorak. 74 percent of typing is done on the homerow, a 4 percent improvement over Dvorak.

## Introduction Q&A

### What is a mechanical keyboard? ###
* A mechanical keyboard is a keyboard that uses a spring and switch mechanism to relay text onto the users screen.

### How does a mechanical keyboard work? ###
* A mechanical keyboard is composed of individual switches that are soldered onto a PCB. Inside each individual switch, there are 6 main components, the stem, slider, contact leaf, contact plate, and spring. **[Read more](#)**

### What makes mechanical keyboard better than their counterparts? ###
* Nothing. Wait what? Yes, if you view keyboards as just a tool to write text, they won't do anything objectively better for the average person. However, mechanical keyboards have a higher life span than traditional keyboards and being able to chose the feeling, design, layout, and aesthetics, is enough for a lot of users to make the switch.

## History ##
So, you made it past the introduction, guessing you're intrigued enough to continue down the slippery rabbit hole that is mechanical keyboards. Let's take a look at the history of mechanical keyboards.

### The first keyboard ###
Not taking into account type writers, which are in fact mechanical, the first keyboard produced was the Datapoint 3300 which was announced in 1967 and started to ship in 1969.

### IBM Keyboards ###
In August 1981, IBM released what people consider to be the greatest keyboard of all time, the IBM Model F. It featured a 101 key layout, mechanical buckling springs, and came in at a wopping 8.3 lbs or 3.7 kilos. Quickly after the release of the Model F, IBM released their newest keyboard that was cheaper to produce, which allowed more users to purchase it and is probably the most famous keyboard of all time. Let's take a look at the IBM Model M. 

The IBM Model M was the first keyboard to introduce the standard qwerty layout, which is one of the biggest gripes about Model F. This layout was so well regarded in fact, that it is still used to this day. The Model M came with membrane buckling springs, which produce more noise, have lower spring resistance, and don't produce the iconic pinging noise that the Model F produced. Instead of the metal case likes it's older brother, it uses a plastic case which reduced the weight and dampened the vibrations produced.

### Today ###
Well, what happend after the release of IBM, Apple, and Dells mechanical keyboards. Well, to put it bluntly, they went to shit. The first design to incoporate the new membrane switch technology, was the DC-50. It wasn't a true membrane keyboard compared to todays keyboards, as it uses strips of metal for contact points. Todays keyboards mostly consist of membrane style switches which use a membrane layer that houses conductive traces, which when pressed down, pushes the membrane layer into the bottom membrane layer which creates a circuit, thus, executing the character.

## Chosing a Mechanical Keyboard ##
Okay enough of this mumbo-jumbo, let's get into the fun stuff, and the reason you probably visited this guide.

### Intro ###
There are a lot of components that define a mechanicalkeyboard. Typically, when building a keyboard or purchasing prebuilt-boards, they all contain the same main components. These components are the switches, PCB, plate, stabilizers, case, and keycaps. Let's take a look at the different options avaliable..

### Switches ###
One of the highlights of mechanical keyboards compared to standard keyboards is the ability to chose your switch. Each switch has a different feel, sound, weight, and characteristics that define it. You can tell what switch you have by looking at the color of the stem. Each different switch typically has a color that correlates to what type it is. Heres how to know what switch suits your needs.

### Switches: Clicky/Tactile/Linear ###

Clicky: 
Clicky switches feature a clickbar that when pressed, give the user tactile feedback and a loud and distinct noise.

Tactile:
Tactile switches have a bump in the downstroke that gives the user tactile feedback, though usually not as big as clicky switches. These switches produce a lot less noise than clicky switches.

Linear:
Linear switches, as the name implies, have a linear downstroke with no tactile feedback and no sound. The only sound you will hear with these keyboards is when bottoming-out.

### Switches Q&A ###

What is the best switch for gaming?

* Despite what you hear from the likes of razer/corsair and keyboards marketed towards gamers, there is no best switch for gaming. It's all marketing propaganda to lure buyers into purchasing their products. Pick a switch that you like and feel comfortable with. Low profile switches in theory should have a faster input time due to the low actuation and travel distance, but it's probably unnoticable.

What is the best switch for typing?

* Like stated above, there is no best switch for typing. It's all personal preference, although a lot of typists prefer clicky or tactile switches because the immediate feedback of knowing you pressed and activated the key.

### Switch Manufactures
Here is a list of switch manufactures and a short summary of who and what they do.

Cherry:
Cherry is a german company that is the most successful switch manufacturer, and one of the first to mass produce mechanical switches.

Gateron: Gateron is a chinese company that produces switches that are similar to cherry mx. Users typically say these switches are smoother than cherry switches, which some people describe as scratchy.

Kailh: Kailh, short for Kaihua Electronicsm, is a company based in china that also produces switches. Kailh also creates custom switches for other companies(ex: Novelkeys).

Razer: Razer first started making keyboards that featured cherry mx switches, but have since moved on to "in house" switches. Despite razers claims, these are actually produced by manufactures Kailh and Greetech, probably to cut costs and increase profit margins.

Romer-G: Romer-G switches are a colab between Logitech and switch manufacture Omron.

Topre: Topre is a japanese company that creates it's own switch that features electro capacitive switches. Although they are technically membrane and not mechanical, I included them because they are great high quality switches with a unique feeling dissimilar to membrane boards.

Alps: Alps was one of the OGs when it comes to switches. Alps produces some of the best switches, and older models of alps boards are harvested for their switches as they are rare.

Matias: As alps was close to being terminated, matias set out to clone the switches instead of cherry switches because cherry switches "felt and sounded cheap to us". These switches are 5x as durable as alps switches and are used in a lot of professional workspaces such as stenography.
